Deep learning is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge.

Deep Learning really shines when it comes to complex problems such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers.

It is a combination of linearity and non-linearity.
